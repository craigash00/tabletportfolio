		<h1>Great Lakes</h1>
		<p>The Great Lakes are a series of freshwater lakes in the mid-west of America. These lakes contain 21% of the World's fresh water.
			<br>There are five lakes within the Great Lakes: Erie, Michigan, Superior, Huron, and Ontario.
		</p>

	<main id="main">
	  <p id='intro'>The Great Lakes contain a fifth of the World's freshwater. Over 35 million people depend on the lakes for their freshwater. Because of this, there are many ongoing conservation efforts along the Great Lakes. </p>
	  <h2 class='chead'>Contamination</h2>
	  <p class='ctext'>Contamination is a big enviromental issue in the Great Lakes. Pollutants include toxic chemicals and invasive species. 
		  Pollutants come from many sources along the Great Lakes such as city runoff, agricultural runoff, industrial discharge, and others.
		  Many organizations have made cleaning up these contaminations their priority, but there is still a lot of work to be done. 
		  Government regulation can help to decrease pollution in the lakes from campanies and cities.

	  </p>
	  <h2 class='chead'>Water Temperatures</h2>
	  <p class='ctext'>Warming water temperatures throughout the Great Lakes are affecting the population levels of species that live in the lakes.
		  Water temperatures impact species livelihood greatly. Certain species of fish like Walleye and Cisco, are expected to not be able to survive the rising temperatures of the water. 
		  Surface water temperatures on Lake Superior, the coldest of the Great Lakes, have risen by 4.5 degrees F in 30 years. This has led to less and less ice cover each year, and greatly affected the wildlife in the Lakes.
	  </p>
	  <h2 class='chead'>Invasive Species</h2>
	  <p class='ctext'>With fishing, travel, and increased human activities, invasive species that are not native to the lakes have been introduced. Many of these species take over the lakes in great numbers, hurting the native species that need the lakes resources to survive.
		  Once a species is established in the lakes, it is extremely hard to get rid of them. Some invasive species include Zebra Musscles, Sea Lamprey, and Round Goby. These invasive species also negatively affect the people that depend on the native species for food or business.
